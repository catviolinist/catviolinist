Hello! I am a musicologist and cat lover readjusting to life in Texas after living in the Netherlands for a little over two years.
I received my Bachelor's of Arts in Music with a minor in history from Texas Tech University (2018) and my Research Master's in Musicology from Utrecht University (2021). I am currently taking programming courses and considering pursuing further education and experience in the field of information science.
My academic research interests are late medieval music, disability studies, digitization, and the preservation of digital content.
